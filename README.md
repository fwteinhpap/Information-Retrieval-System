# Information-Retrieval-WordNet-Word2vec
Building an information retrieval model for queries  <br> 
#### This project has been made for the course of *Information Retrieval* offered by the *Athens University of Economics and Business* at the spring semester 2020. <br>
The project is separated in 3 steps :
1. I have built a simple index which is used to answer the queries.
2. I have built an index using **wordNet** and making any additional removals or addings to improve the model in order to answer the queries
3. I used the **word2vec Neural Network** to make extra synonyms for the queries. 

In each step the folder "IR2020" contains subfolders that has the saved index , the necessary docs (documents,results from the model) and inside the folder docs the trec_eval.exe 
which has been used to mining the results. Also , there are reports in greek language with the results and comparing with the previous steps.
<br>--The project uses lucene_7.7.2
